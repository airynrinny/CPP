/*The answers to a true-false test are as follows: T T F
F T. Given a two-dimensional answer array, in which each row corresponds to the
answers provided on one test, write a function that accepts the two-dimensional
array and number of tests as parameters and returns a one-dimensional array
containing the grades for each test. (Each question is worth 5 points so that the
maximum possible grade is 25.) Test your function with the following data:
int score = 0;

cporect answer as one dimensional array
two dimensional array for the marks */
